## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Traditional manual marking of theory-based examinations presents significant challenges in modern educational systems. Teachers spend approximately 40-60% of their time on assessment activities, leading to delayed feedback and inconsistent grading standards (UTHM Research, 2023). The increasing student population and demand for immediate feedback necessitate innovative solutions that can maintain assessment quality while improving efficiency.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The current manual marking process suffers from several limitations:
- **Time Consumption**: Manual marking requires extensive time investment
- **Human Bias**: Subjective assessment leads to inconsistent results
- **Delayed Feedback**: Students receive feedback weeks after examination
- **Limited Analytics**: Lack of comprehensive performance insights
- **Scalability Issues**: Difficulty handling large examination batches

### 1.3 Research Objectives

**Primary Objective:**
Develop an intelligent AI-powered system that automates theory-based examination marking while maintaining accuracy and providing immediate feedback.

**Specific Objectives:**
1. Implement robust OCR technology for text extraction from handwritten scripts
2. Design intelligent marking algorithms using AI and machine learning
3. Create a user-friendly web interface for teachers and administrators
4. Develop mobile application for script capture and submission
5. Establish comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities
6. Validate system performance through comparative analysis

### 1.4 Research Questions

1. How effective is AI-assisted marking compared to traditional manual assessment?
2. What level of accuracy can be achieved using OCR technology for handwritten text?
3. How does automated marking impact teacher workload and student learning outcomes?
4. What are the key factors influencing the adoption of AI-assisted marking systems?

### 1.5 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:**
- Theory-based examination marking
